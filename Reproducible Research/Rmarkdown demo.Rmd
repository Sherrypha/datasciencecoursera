My First R Markdown file
========================

This is my first R markdown file

Here we are going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
summary(airquality)
```

Lets first make a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

here is a regression model of Ozone on wind, solar radiation and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R+ Temp, data = airquality )
summary(fit)
```
Here's an ordered list

* first element
* second element
